Designed and developed a Flutter-based mobile application during my internship as an Application Developer, focused on educational resource management. The app generates comprehensive ZIP files that include previous year exam questions, predictive next year questions, and in-depth report analysis. It features seamless integration with custom APIs to ensure accurate content delivery across various subjects and levels. Additionally, the app allows users to easily bookmark, download, and access materials, offering a secure and intuitive experience that enhances learning and exam preparation.
